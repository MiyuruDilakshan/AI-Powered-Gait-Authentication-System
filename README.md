# AI-Powered-Gait-Authentication-System
This project implements a gait-based authentication system using neural networks to verify identity from smartwatch accelerometer and gyroscope data. It achieves a 2.04% Equal Error Rate in cross-day testing, showing the feasibility of transparent, continuous security for wearable devices.
